### Project overview

Seating location is commonly linked to grade performance, student engagement, and learning experience. Nevertheless, the question remains whether certain personality dispositions systematically influence where students prefer to sit in a classroom. This project aims to explore the question: **Does self-reported competitiveness influence where an individual prefers to sit in class?**
