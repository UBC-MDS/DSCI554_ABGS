# Survey

Survey to 69 Master of Data Science students at the University of British Columbia. The main objective of this survey is to explore the question: **Does self-reported competitiveness influence where an individual prefers to sit in class?**

The survey will measure _self-reported competitiveness_ with the following two questions (adapted from BÃ¶nte, Lombardo, & Urbig, 2017):

**Q1**: Do you enjoy situations in which you compete with others?

**Q2**: Do you prefer competing with others when pursuing a goal over pursuing the goal alone?

Participants will answer these two questions using a 5-point Likert scale, with 1 being "very much not so", and 5 being "very much so". The average score of these two questions will be used as a measurement for _competitiveness_.

The survey will collect _seating preference_ with the following question:

**Q3**: Where do you prefer to sit in a classroom?

- [ ] Front of the class
- [ ] Middle of the class
- [ ] Back of the class
- [ ] Prefer not to respond

### Potential confounds

Gender has been directly linked to both student seating (Shernoff, et al., 2017), and competitiveness (Buser, Niederle, & Oosterbeek, 2012). For this reason, the survey will also collect _gender_ using the following question: 

**Q4**: What gender do you identify with?

- [ ] Male
- [ ] Female
- [ ] Other
- [ ] Prefer not to respond

Students who sit in the back of the classroom are found to be less engaged (Shernoff, et al., 2017), while competitive individuals are typically more engaged in a task (Karatepe & Olugbade, 2009). The survey will therefore measure _student engagement_ as a potential confound, using the following questions (adapted from Shernoff, et al., 2017):

**Q5**: Did you enjoy what you were doing in the MDS program? (enjoyment)

**Q6**: Do you often find your mind wander off in class? (reverse coded) (concentration)

**Q7**: Do you find the course content in MDS to be interesting? (interest)

These questions will be answered using a 5-point Likert scale, with 1 being "very much not so", and 5 being "very much so". The average score of these questions will be used as a measurement for _engagement_.
