	abstract = {Gender differences in competitiveness are often discussed as a potential explanation for gender differences in education and labor market outcomes. We correlate an incentivized measure of competitiveness with an important career choice of secondary school students in the Netherlands. At the age of 15, these students have to pick one out of four study profiles, which vary in how prestigious they are. While boys and girls have very similar levels of academic ability, boys are substantially more likely than girls to choose more prestigious profiles. We find that competitiveness is as important a predictor of profile choice as gender. More importantly, up to 23 percent of the gender difference in profile choice can be attributed to gender differences in competitiveness. This lends support to the extrapolation of laboratory findings on competitiveness to labor market settings.},

	abstract = {This study examines the relationship between economic and psychological approaches to measure individuals' competitiveness. While psychologists typically use self-reported psychometric scales, economists tend to use behavioral measures obtained from economic experiments, where subjects confronted with speciﬁc paid tasks have to select into either a competitive or a piece-rate payment scheme. Both measurement approaches have remained largely isolated from one another. We demonstrate that a standard behavioral measure and a psychometric scale of individual competitiveness are positively associated, but distinguishable with respect to the role of personal development motives. While self-reported competitiveness also emerges from personal development motives, the behavioral measure does not reﬂect such motives. The distinction between both measures is validated based on divergent associations with personality and interests in a competitive career.},

	abstract = {Seating position in university lectures is commonly linked with student grade performance. Sitting at the front of lecture theatre is generally reported to have a positive effect on final grade. This study investigates and analyses the seating positions, course engagement, prior programming experiences and academic abilities of students throughout a 12 week Java programming university programme and relates these themes to the students' final grade performances. Unlike other studies in this area it did not control the students' seating arrangements. This required the development of a mobile and web based software tracking system which enabled a unique unrestricted study of the effects of lecture theatre seating on assessment performance. It finds that the best assessment results were achieved by the students in the front row and that assessment score degraded the further students sat from the front. While the most engaged were found to regularly sit at the front the same was not true for the most academically able or those with the greatest prior programming experience.},

	abstract = {Our study developed and tested a research model, which predicted the impacts of job (supervisor support) and personal resources (trait competitiveness and self-efﬁcacy) on work engagement. Respondents were full-time employed frontline employees of the ﬁve- and four-star hotels of Abuja, the capital city of Nigeria. We used path analysis in LISREL 8.30 for testing the study hypotheses. The results demonstrated that trait competitiveness predicted three dimensions of work engagement better than did self-efﬁcacy. That is, trait competitiveness enhanced frontline employees’ feelings of vigor, dedication, and absorption, while self-efﬁcacy signiﬁcantly and positively inﬂuenced only absorption. Unexpectedly, supervisor support had no signiﬁcant effects on three dimensions of work engagement. The results further revealed that frontline employees who had elevated levels of competitiveness and adequate supervisor support in the workplace had higher self-efﬁcacy beliefs. Implications of the empirical ﬁndings and limitations are discussed in our study.},

Participants (N ¼ 407) were students in two cohorts of an undergraduate ﬁnancial accounting course at a large university in the United States. They participated in the Experience Sampling Method measuring their self-reported seating location, engagement, attention, and other experiential dimensions throughout the one-semester course. Results showed that students reported lower engagement, attention, and quality of classroom experience when sitting in the back of the classroom than when sitting in the middle or front. Those sitting in the back of the classroom most of the time also received lower course grades. Engagement, attention, and other experiential factors mediated the inﬂuence of seating location on course grade. Multilevel models revealed both within-student and between-student effects of seating on classroom experience.},

It has often been described and deﬁned, but few studies have examined the range of psychological beneﬁts it provides. This study investigated the experienced psychological beneﬁts of place attachment by content analyzing community members' descriptions of places to which they consider themselves attached. Using an inductive approach, their responses were coded for themes of reported psychological beneﬁts. Thirteen categories of beneﬁts were revealed: memories, belonging, relaxation, positive emotions, activity support, comfort-security, personal growth, freedom, entertainment, connection to nature, practical beneﬁts, privacy, and aesthetics. Variations in the reported beneﬁts were explored as a function of place type, geographical scale, and demographic characteristics. This study provides heuristic insights into the experienced psychological beneﬁts of place attachment.},
